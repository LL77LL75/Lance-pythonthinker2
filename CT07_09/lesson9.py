# **Task 1b**: Drawing the finish line
# Adding on to your previous answer, create a line of black
# squares at y = 250 by creating a black square turtle object
# and stamping it from  to x = 300 at 25 pixel-
# intervals

# 1. Create a turtle object named 'pen'
# 2. Lift the pen up
# 3. Using '.shape()', set the turtle object's shape to "square"
# 4. Using '.sety()', set turtle object's y position to 250
# 5. Using a 'for i in range()' loop, use the 'i' variable to
#    create a stamp of 'pen' turtle object from x = -300 to
#    x = 300 at 25-pixel intervals:
#         a. Set 'pen' turtle's x coordinate using '.setx()'
#         b. Stamp a copy of 'pen' turtle at its current
#            position using '.stamp()'

# Tip: Use '.mainloop()' at the end of your program to keep the
# window open

# You should see this when you run the program! (Refer to slides)


# **Task 1c**: Drawing the start line
# Adding on to your previous answer, use the 'pen' turtle object
# you have created earlier to draw a horizontal yellow start
# line at y = -250.

# 1. Using '.goto()', set 'pen' turtle's coordinates to
#    (-300, -250)
# 2. Using the following commands, set the colour of 'pen' to
#    "yellow", set heading to 0 and move forward by 600
#    before hiding the turtle:
#         a. '.pencolor()'
#         b. '.pendown()'
#         c. '.seth()'
#         d. '.forward()'
#         e. '.hideturtle()'

# Tip: Use '.mainloop()' at the end of your program to keep the
# window open
